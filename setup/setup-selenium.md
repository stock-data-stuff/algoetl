# STEPS

## Ubuntu
sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver

## Windows
Get the latest windows 64-bit binary from
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
and put it in your windows PATH.
One easy way to do that is to put it in the Scripts directory in the Python
virtual env directory you are using.
