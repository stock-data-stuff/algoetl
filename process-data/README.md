# GOAL
Read the data in the feed-history directory and create a 
unified (denormalized) table with all data found there.

Then, export the denormalized table as a CSV file in the ~/Downloads folder.

# Notes
Spark code was retired since the data here is not big.
The startup times for Spark were not justified here.

Some Spark code is left in "unused_for_now" for future use.
