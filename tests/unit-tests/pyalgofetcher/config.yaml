# List the feeds in this section

# Every feed is identified by a key (e.g. FED_Soma)
# Do not use a key (under "feeds:") of "ALL" since it is reserved to mean "load all feeds here"
#
# Each feed must have a type
# It's helpful to group feeds here by type (for human readability)
#
# Each feed must have an "args" key containing a "symbol" key.
# The symbol is used to identify the feed (e.g. name the directory that holds the feed)
